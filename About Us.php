<h3><i><b>Our mission is to bring all the lost person to their home, or to bring the information to the lost people to their families, our workers collect information about these lost people and regularly update the information on website.</i><b></h3>

<h5><b>Today, I understand the struggle of these families. But it doesn’t make things any easier for them.
Someone goes missing every 30 seconds and that’s a fact. The main stream media is not much (if any) help to missing
which don’t fit a specific criteria. In addition to being ignored by the media, many families of missing persons run against the “Blue Wall” of justice,
law enforcement agencies that refuse to do their jobs either due to corruption, inefficiency, laziness or lack of funds.
Either way its inexcusable. The reality is that thousands of families go through this every day with no end in sight.
You can search about your missing person on this website, and can get notification about found person through your email.
